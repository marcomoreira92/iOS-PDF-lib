##ABOUT:
This library bundles together two PDF libraries, the VFR library (http://www.vfr.org/) for the PDF viewer and KurtCode/PDFKitten (https://github.com/KurtCode/PDFKitten) for the search engine.

PDF lib was developed in Objective C, while the example App was written in Swift 2.1.

For sugestions and code corrections please contact me so we can make this library better forfuture implementations.

To change the PDF Reader theme color please check the Constants.m file.
